# DCIT318 - Programming II Assignment 2

**Student Name:** Franklina Addae  
**Student ID:** 11262526

## Description
This is a C# console application developed for DCIT 318 Assignment 2. The assignment demonstrates three core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles:

---

## ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Inheritance and Method Overriding
- A base class `Animal` defines a method `MakeSound()` which prints a generic message.
- Derived classes `Dog` and `Cat` override this method to print specific animal sounds.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Abstract Classes and Methods
- An abstract class `Shape` defines an abstract method `GetArea()`.
- `Circle` and `Rectangle` are subclasses that implement `GetArea()` to return the area of the respective shapes.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Interfaces
- An interface `IMovable` defines a method `Move()`.
- `Car` and `Bicycle` classes implement this interface and provide their own version of `Move()`.

---

## ðŸ’» How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/dcit318-assignment2-11262526.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
cd dcit318-assignment2-11262526


3. Run the application:
dotnet run

4. The output will display the results for all three tasks in a single console run.
